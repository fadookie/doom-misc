========================================
             INSTRUCTIONS               
========================================

1) Download all the tools listed in the "Prerequisites" section. These must be
installed and configured properly, otherwise your project will not compile
properly.

2) Extract all of the tools to any directory on your hard disk. I have mine
set up in D:\Games\DOOM\UTILS, like so:

D:\
	Games\
		DOOM\
			UTILS\
				ACC\
				FBINSERTER\

You can install your stuff any way you like; this is just an example.

Be sure to also properly install 7-Zip (either by using the installer, or
manually extracting it to your preferred location).

3) Add all of the tools to your PATH...

	3.A) If you're using Windows XP, right-click My Computer, Properties, then
	click on the "Advanced" tab. Look for the "Environment Variables" button.

	3.B) For Windows Vista, right-click My Computer, Properties, and under the
	"Tasks" sidebar to the left, choose "Advanced system settings". Now click
	the "Advanced" tab, then click the "Environment Variables" button at the
	bottom.

	3.C) For Windows 7, right-click My Computer, Properties. Under the "Control
	Panel Home" sidebar to the left, choose "Advanced system settings". Choose
	the "Advanced" tab, then finally the "Environment Variables" button at the
	bottom.
	
	3.D) Windows 8, open the Start menu, then in the Search box, type Control
	Panel. Scroll down to System and click it. Look to the left sidebar for
	"Advanced System Settings" and click it. Under the "Advanced" tab, click
	the "Environment Variables" button at the bottom.

4) Look under the "System variables" box, and scroll down until you see the
variable named "PATH". Now hit "Edit..." - you should see a long string of
stuff in the "Variable value" text box. DO NOT modify this as it has important
stuff that Windows has configured for you. Instead, move your text cursor
to the end of the text box (left-click anywhere in the text box, then hit
the "End" key on your keyboard). You are now going to add new directories
to your PATH. For every new directory you add into this text box, you must
end it with a semicolon (;).

5) Be sure your cursor is at the end of the text box. If there isn't any
semi colon at the end of the last directory defined in the text box, add it
in now.

6) Now add the directories of all the prerequisite tools into your PATH.
For example, mine would look something like below. Modify the pathnames
according to your system's needs.

d:\games\doom\utils\acc;d:\games\doom\utils\image2textures;d:\games\doom\utils\fbinserter;C:\Program Files\7-Zip;

REMEMBER, ADD TO THE PATH, DO NOT OVERWRITE YOUR EXISTING PATH ENTRIES OR
YOU'LL RISK SCREWING UP YOUR WINDOWS INSTALLATION! IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHAT
YOU ARE DOING, HIT THE CANCEL BUTTON AND GET SOMEONE TO HELP YOU OR GOOGLE
SEARCH FOR "WINDOWS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES" AND READ UP ON IT!

7) Now that everything is setup, extract the project template anywhere on
your hard disk. For example, D:\Games\DOOM\myproj\.

8) You may rename the "myproj" directory to whatever your project name is.
I'm not sure what'll happen if the name contains more than 8 characters, but
just to be safe, I'd recommend you limit your directory name to 8 characters.
For example, "mynewmod".

9) Edit compile.bat, go to line 20 and 21, and edit the path to your (G)ZDoom
executable and also the EXE itself.

10) Go to line 24 and set the path to your mod. For example,
D:\Games\DOOM\myproj\. If your mod is located elsewhere, for example
E:\John\Projects\mynewmod - then make sure it is entered correctly.

Now save the changes you made to compile.bat

11) Edit make_pk3.bat, go to line 9 and change the name of your final PK3 here.
make_pk3.bat is only used to compile and finalize everything and neatly package
them all into a PK3 for release/distribution. Save your changes.

12) You are done! Navigate into the "src" directory. I have included commonly
used lumps for your convenience, and created some example content for you.
You are now basically working on your mod by editing the files directly on your
hard disk. No more WAD tools needed!

13) Whenever you need to run your project, just double-click play.bat. If
there were no errors in your ACS and you have correctly set the path to your
(G)ZDoom executables, the game should run. I have added error checking for
ACS scripts, so the game will not start if any ACS errors come up.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

========================================
               MISC TIPS                
========================================

You can use your favourite text editor to edit your ACS scripts. I personally
use Notepad++.

Your map scripts are now stored in the maps directory. If you are using
(GZ)Doom Builder, there is no need to use the built-in script editor. Just
edit the ACS files directly in the maps directory.

grabpng can be used to offset your PNG sprites. Associate your PNG files with
grabpng, so that you can right-click your PNG, choose Open With -> grabpng.

The latest development builds of SLADE 3 can also be used to offset your PNGs -
there is a new "Open Directory" feature in File menu in the latest version of
SLADE that allows you to do just that.

The compiler ignores directories named "src" - so how is this useful? If you're
working with graphics, you can store your "master files" inside an "src"
directory and it'll be ignored during runtime. For example, if you're a
Photoshop user, then no doubt you'd want to keep your master PSD files around
in case you need to change anything. So if you have a high resolution TITLEPIC
that you created in Photoshop, you'd create an "src" directory inside the
"graphics" directory. TITLEPIC.PSD would go into the "src" directory, and
TITLEPIC.PNG (the lump that (G)ZDoom will show) will go into the "graphics"
directory. See the following example.

D:\
	Games\
		DOOM\
			myproj\
				src\
					graphics\
						titlepic.png
					src\
						titlepic.psd

Hope this makes sense. It's done this way because you do not want to have both
the PSD and the PNG file in the "graphics" directory - (G)ZDoom will complain
about this.

Happy modding!
